# pipifax-lang

Example code for a compiler construction class at the [DHBW Stuttgart](https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de).

See [pipifax-spec.md](pipifax-spec.md) for the language specification.

The Pipifax compiler is written in an incremental fashion. See
[assignments.md](assignments.md) for the details. Each assignment adds
to the functionality of the compiler. The example code for each assignment
can be found on a corresponding branch in this repo.
